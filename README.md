# AnomalyDetection
This projects highlights the use of Autoencoders, a deep learning model, to identify anomalies and check its performance.

Autoencoders can be effectively used for anomaly detection by leveraging their ability to learn compressed representations of input data. 
By comparing the reconstruction error of new data instances with a pre-defined threshold, autoencoders can identify 
anomalies in the data, providing a valuable tool for various applications, such as fraud detection, system monitoring, and quality control.
